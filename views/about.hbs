  <h2>About</h2>
  <br />
  <p>Welcome to our website! My name is Mayank Kumar, and I'm the developer
    behind this platform. Originally, this website was built as part of my web
    programming course at Seneca College. However, I've since expanded and
    enhanced it with a user-friendly UI and additional features to provide a
    more comprehensive experience.</p>

  <p>This website is built using a combination of technologies, including
    Handlebars, Bootstrap, MongoDB, and Postgres. These technologies allow for
    efficient and robust development, ensuring a seamless user experience and
    smooth performance.One of the key features of this website is the
    integration of Cloudinary for image management. Cloudinary allows for easy
    uploading, storage, and manipulation of images, ensuring that your content
    is visually appealing and engaging.In addition to the technical aspects,
    I've also implemented user authentication to enhance security and provide
    personalized experiences. With user authentication, you can create an
    account, log in securely, and access exclusive features and content.</p>

  <p>I'm committed to delivering a high-quality platform that meets your needs.
    I've designed this website with a user-centric approach, focusing on
    intuitive navigation and a visually pleasing interface. Your satisfaction is
    my priority, and I'm continuously working to improve and enhance the website
    based on user feedback.Thank you for visiting our website. I hope you find
    it informative, enjoyable, and useful. If you have any questions or
    feedback, please don't hesitate to reach out. I'm here to assist you and
    make your experience on this platform exceptional.</p>

  <h2>Exciting Updates Coming Soon!</h2>
  <br />
  <p>Stay tuned for upcoming updates and enhancements to our platform. I am
    working hard to bring you new features and improvements that will elevate
    your experience.</p>
  <p>One of the exciting updates I have planned is the ability to edit the
    titles and images of your existing blogs. I understand that your ideas may
    evolve over time, and I want to make it easy for you to refine and update
    your content.In addition, I'll be introducing separate user profiles where
    you can showcase your personal blogs. This will provide you with a dedicated
    space to connect with your readers and build a community around your
    writing.</p>

  <p>But that's not all! I have more exciting features in the pipeline,
    including enhanced search functionality, improved social sharing options,
